  Title : "A Branch-and-Cut algorithm for the Proactive Countermeasures Selection Problem."
  
  Abstract : "We consider the Proactive Countermeasures Selection Problem (PCSP). An instance of the PCSP is given by a triplet (G, K, D). Here, G is a directed graph called the Risk Assessment Graph, where the set of nodes is partitioned into a set of attack access points and a set of  asset-vulnerability nodes (to be secured). Each arc of G has a positive weight representing the difficulty of propagation. K is a set of available countermeasures to place on the asset-vulnerability nodes. The placement of a countermeasure on a node increases the weight of its ongoing arcs by the effect of the countermeasure and has a positive cost. D is a positive security threshold vector. The PCSP consists in selecting a set of countermeasures, at minimal cost, such that the security thresholds are respected. A bilevel model, as well as a compact and a path formulation were introduced to solve the PCSP. In this work, we give polyhedral results and a Branch-and-Cut algorithm developed for solving the path formulation as well as some numerical results showing the eciency of the algorithm. "
  
  

### September
- September 17th - 14h (Salle 2329)
  
  Speaker :  Alice Nassor
  
  Title : "A convergent iterative method for global-in-time elastodynamic-acoustic FEM-BEM coupling."
  
  Abstract : "This talk concerns the fluid-structure interaction occurring during the impact of an underwater shock wave on a submerged structure. To simulate the phenomenon an iterative, global-in-time FEM-BEM coupling is studied. The present contribution highlights two possible formulations of this coupling: one based on Neumann transmission conditions at the interface between the fluid and solid domains, and the other based on Robin conditions. We will show the convergence of the Robin scheme and justifying the non-convergence of the Neumann scheme. We will also discuss other possible iterative FEM-BEM coupling method."
